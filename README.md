# Experimental NixOS configuration for Freifunk Luxembourg

[Freifunk Luxembourg](https://freifunk.lu) is a free, non-commerial, meshed wireless network, which is part of the broader [Freifunk community](https://freifunk.net).

To achieve such a network, some degree of coordination and services are required. This repository currently serves as an experiment to test the viability of [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) for [Freifunk Luxembourg](https://freifunk.lu) specifically.

For context, [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) has successfully been used before in various Freifunk communities, such as [Freifunk Rhein-Neckar](https://ffrn.de/) or [Freifunk Darmstadt](https://darmstadt.freifunk.net/).
The current state of automation and systems within Freifunk Luxembourg has pushed us to explore alternatives.
